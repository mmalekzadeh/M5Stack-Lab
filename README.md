# M5Stack-Lab
A tutorial on how to get your hands dirty on the combination of M5stack, Arduino, and Jupyter Notebook. This tutorial is originally created for the Ambient Sensing Lab (DE4-SIOT Sensing and IOT,2018-2019, module) at Imperial College Faculty of Engineering.

## What is the M5Stack and what can it be used for?

The M5Stack is essentially a ESP32 development board, which comes with a screen, microphone and other features built-in, which makes it programmable through the Arduino IDE, yet modular and easy to use.
You can program the M5Stack to become a clock, timer, GPS, Accelerometer, Gyroscope, Microphone/Recorder, MP3 Player, Temperature sensor (or regulator), Voice-Initiated Light Switch, and many more things. It is intended to turn your idea into a prototype product with a simple code. 
In this tutorial you will learn how to collect and use the M5Stack built in Gyro and Accelerometer and Temperature sensor data to complete time series data analyses.
